          writelarge: Steve Jobs confounded Apple in his parents' garage in
          1976, was ousted in 1985, return to rescue it from near bankruptcy in
          1997, and by the time he died, in october 2011, had built it into the
          world's most valuable company. Along the way he helped to transform
          seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music,
          phones,tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He
          thus belongs int he pantheon of America s great innovators, alongeith
          Thomsa Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was a
          saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history will
          remember how they applied imagination to tchnology and business.
